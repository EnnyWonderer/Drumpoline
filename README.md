# Drumpoline
Trampoline controller for musical compositions

I'm Going to create a patch that allows a trampoline to compose a piece of music by syncing tempo to the users jump rate and triggering samples/midi notes based on the position of the trampoline which an impact is made with. it would be cool if the final outcome is a classical piece and the composer is the user on a tampoline. maybe it will even be use for some form of gymnast show
